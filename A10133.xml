            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>BVt before he comes to the point, he makes a preface, in the which he handleth three points; firſt, to whom it apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines to reade the Scriptures. Secondly, with what ſpirit they muſt be read. Thirdly, vnto whom the expounding and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preting of the Scriptures appertaine. And all to this end, that (hauing giuen them to vnderſtand &amp; beleeue, that it is not for all men to reade the Scriptures, and that they muſt receiue the interpretation and ſenſe of the Scriptures of thoſe, whom hee calles <hi>Our ſpirituall Fathers, Pastors and Doctors</hi>); wee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware to imitate the couragious men of Berea, who hauing heard the preaching of Saint <hi>Paul,</hi>

The Scriptures doe giue precepts of vertue, and one muſt bring the vertues of a pure ſpirit and of charity in the reading of the Scriptures. The Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures are in the diuine bookes, the vertues are in our hearts; therefore the mountaine of vertues is not the mountaine of Scriptures, that is his ſecond ſlip. His third error is, in that he conſiders not, that the Scripture was giuen in the mountaine, and brought by <hi>Moſes</hi> to all the people, who did commaund him to reade it; and therfore the mountaine was not the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: for the people was forbid to come neere the mountaine, and was commanded to approch the Scripture, and to reade it. He did not conſider, that the mountaine of Sinai, was at that preſent time the throne of the Iuſtice of God, terrifying the conſciences of men by his Law; and therefore forbidding the people to approch it, vnder paine of death. And that the Chriſtians freed and deliuered from the terrours of the mountaine of Sinai, are come vnto the mountaine of Sion, which is the throne of Gods mercie, comforting the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences of men by his Goſpell. Then ſpeakes hee but lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle to the purpoſe, yea, nothing at all of the mountaine Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nai, ſeeing now wee Chriſtians know no other then that of Sion; that is his fourth error, followed with a fifth groſſe fault, that he did not marke, that <hi>Moſes</hi> alone went vp to the mountaine, when God did dictate his Law, becauſe God had ordained him

Who ſeeth not, that here are foure termes (as Schoolemen ſpeake), and that the concluſion ſayes more, then the premiſe doe afforde? let vs make a new this Syllogiſme; All Chriſtians ought to be like vnto Chriſt in all things: but Chriſt hath ſaid nothing, hath done nothing, but that which his Father hath told him, and commaunded him: the maiden daughters therefore, of whom the queſtion is, ought to ſay nothing, to doe nothing, but that which their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hath told them and commanded; and conſequently they ought not, nor may not enter into the new religion, and religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Houſe or Cloiſter of Saint <hi>Vrſula</hi> the Virgin, becauſe their father hath told them, and commaunded them not to doe it. Let vs make it of another faſhion; All Chriſtians muſt be like vnto Chriſt in all things: but Chriſt hath ſpoken of all thoſe things, which he hath heard of his Father, who is God, the true One, and holy One; Therefore we muſt hold all that we haue heard of our Fathers, of whom he moſt holy is but man and not God, is a ſinner,

                  <p>I Doe not pretend to abate or diminiſh in any wiſe the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie of the Fathers, I ſay, that they haue been great men of God; that they haue ſerued God, and his Church in their time with great profit; that their writings are of great vſe, and that by the reading of them, a man may become wiſer and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier. And I hold for certaine, that they are bound in the bun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle of life, and doe raigne in heauen with Chriſt Ieſus their King, for whoſe ſake God hath been mercifull vnto them. But when men make a buckler of their errors; and when men ſay, that we may not ſpeake of the Scripture, but as they are inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted by them; we are inforced to ſay the truth, that, firſt, they all were men, and not God: ſecondly, they were all diſciples of the truth, and not Author of the ſame; all Interpreters of the law, not Law-giuers; all our fellow-Brethren, and fellow-Seruants, and not our Maſters. Thirdly, that we ought to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue them in matters of fact, or of things done in their time, and that which they aſſuredly know, when they ſpeake of
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:12289:33"/>things not by heare-ſay, but which themſelues haue ſeene and knowne theſe certain things. Fourthly, that in matters of faith they are not to bee beleeued, if they proue not their doctrine by the bookes of faith, becauſe as

                     <hi>Canus</hi> ſaith, <hi>All the Saints (thoſe onely excepted, who haue digested and committed vnto writing the Canonicall bookes) haue ſpoken by human ſpirit, and haue ſometimes erred in things which appertaine to faith.</hi> The reaſon is,
<note n="b" place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.9.</note> 
                     <hi>They knew onely in part, and propheſied in part.

                        <hi>Iohn</hi> 16.13.</note> 
                     <hi>in all truth.</hi> Fifthly, that the Spirit of Chriſt Ieſus is not dead with them, but is as yet in his Church, enlightning it in the truth, and ſanctifying her by the truth; in ſo much, as although there were no writings of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, the people of God for all that, ſhould not leaue to know &amp; vnderſtand the Scriptures, to know the voyce of Chriſt, and follow it. Sixthly, that the writings of the Fathers are as much, or more obſcure, then the holy Scriptures, if it might bee ſaid without blaſphemy, that there were obſcureneſſe in thoſe bookes which were dictated by him,
<note n="e" place="margin">
                        <hi>Iohn</hi> 1.9.</note> 
                     <hi>Who is the light, which lighteth euery man that commeth into the world.</hi> Seuenthly, that the fathers are ſo many in number, &amp; their writings in like manner, that though a man had an iron body, he could not take the paines to reade them all; and though he had a memory of ſteele, he could not remember the expoſitions of all of them; that there is no man liuing which hath them all, no man liuing which hath read all thoſe we haue; yea, I ſuppoſe and preſume that I may ſay truely, that all the liuing together haue not read them all: whereas all can, and may reade the Scripture ouer and ouer, euery one oftentimes, &amp; learne by it with prayer and labour, all that is neceſſarie for their ſaluation. Eightly &amp; laſtly, that the Scriptures are ſnatched out of the peoples hands, detei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in ſuch a brutiſh ignorance, that they cannot know if the things written by the Fathers are of the Scripture or no; &amp; the meanes to reade the Fathers is taken away from them, ſo that they cannot know how they expound the Scriptures; and therefore it is a meere mockerie to ſend the ignorant to the
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:12289:33"/>Fathers, which they haue neuer read, which they cannot reade though they would, and dare not reade them though they could, and whom they cannot vnderſtand, though they ſhould reade them; and therefore are taught to referre themſelues in all theſe things to that, which their Paſtors and Doctors will make them beleeue.</p>
                  <p n="2">II. This is the ſenſe of that which followeth in the Paſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall letter, where, to that which hath been ſaid, that we ought not to ſpeake of the Scriptures otherwiſe, then the fathers expound them, is added, <hi>And beſides, your ſpirituall Fathers, Paſtors and Doctors, that are inſtituted of God, grounded on the lawfull ſucceſſion of the Apoſtles to expound and interpret it to you;

                  </p>
                  <p n="3">III. We ought not to take away from the true Paſtors and Doctors any thing of that which God giues them, Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith of himſelfe and of all,

                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> no ſcruple concerning this whole matter in the conſcience of the Reader. We ſay, that the Iudge of the ſenſe and meaning of the Scripture, is ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:12289:35"/>
                     <hi>publick</hi> or <hi>priuate.</hi> The publike Iudge is he, who iudgeth publikely with a publike authoritie, and declares, what is true, what is falſe, good or bad; what one ought to follow or eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chew, doe, or not doe in matter of religion. <hi>The publike Iudge is either Soueraigne or Miniſteriall.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">II. The Soueraigne Iudge is hee, whoſe authoritie is in himſelfe, and towards vs ſufficient; irrefragable, and ſo abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute, that neceſſitie is laid vpon vs to yeeld and agree vnto, without any doubting, contradiction or appeale. There is no ſuch Iudge in heauen or in earth but one, to wit, <hi>God</hi> ſpeaking to his Church in Chriſt Ieſus by his holy Spirit. There is but he alone, which hath publike and abſolute authoritie; who go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernes, ſwaies and commands ouer the conſciences; who can perſwade, binde, and conuince them. He hath giuen his iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and ſentence, and hath enregiſtred it in the ſacred Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, according to which he gouernes the conſciences, bowing &amp; bending them to the obedience of the ſame by his holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit. And indeed what other could be the Soueraigne Iudge of the ſenſe of the Scripture, but he, who is the author of the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture? who can better interpret a mans words &amp; meaning, then he which hath ſpoken them? And who can better interpret the ſenſe and meaning of the Law, then the Law-giuer which hath made it? who is ſo fit and apt for it as hee, who being all wiſe and all holy, cannot; and being all good, will not deceiue or beguile vs?</p>

A King, who is but a man hath ſuch a power, and ſhall not the King of Kings haue it? a mortall man, abſent in body, ſhall bee acknowledged of all his good ſubiects for ſupreme Iudge; and his will declared in writing, ſhall bee a Law vnto them: and ſhall not the Lord Ieſus, God-Man, and Man-God, be accepted of for Soueraine Iudge, nor his writings for lawes, vnleſſe he make and ſhew himſelfe viſible and preſent?

As the publike miniſterial iudgement is (without propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and meaſure) inferior to that of God reuealed in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; ſo the priuate iudgment is inferior to the miniſterial: for it comes not out in publike with a publike calling and authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie; but keepes and containes it ſelfe in the conſcience for her reſt and peace, and doth not extend or ſpread her ſelfe further then the calling of him, which hath receiued this gift of God. This is common to all true Chriſtians, who being all ſpirituall man, haue receiued and had of God, the eyes, eares, taſte, heart, and iudgement of the ſpirituall man; to ſee, heare, taſte, know, iudge, loue and affect the things of God.

Chriſtians are the ſheepe of our Lord Ieſus; As therefore a naturall ſheepe can by the principle of nature make choiſe of that herbe, which is the moſt wholeſome to her; and in feeding paſſe by that, which is contrary to her nature: ſo the ſpirituall ſheepe, by the principle of grace, can iudge betweene the true paſſages and places, vnto the which ſhe is brought and led by her true ſhepheard; and the bad paſture, wherewith the ſtronger would infect and poyſon her. This doctrine is of Chriſt Ieſus, and of his Apoſtles: Chriſt hath ſaid, that

                        <hi>Bell. de Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ach. c.</hi> 13. §. 11.</note> that to loue God with all his heart, and with all his ſoule, is nothing elſe but to loue him truely, ſincerely, without faining, without diſſimula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and that to loue him with all his ſtrength, is to loue him <hi>pro viribus</hi> according to his ſtrength. He ſaith ſomewhat, but he ſayes not all: for God lookes not to that which the ſinner, apoſtat, bankrupt of his graces can now doe. He askes and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acts that which man, whom hee hath created according to his image, inricht with all his bleſſings, made a guardian of all his goods doth owe him. That man hath receiued of God his bodie, his ſoule, all his faculties, all the powers of his ſoule; he owes then himſelfe wholly vnto God; and there is nothing in him, which ought not to be inceſſantly bandied and bent to his ſeruice, and to the ſeruice of his neighbour for his ſake, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out reſeruation and exception of degree, without reſtriction of condition, without limitation of time. All that which man thinkes, ſaies, doth, ought to be thought, ſaid, done for Gods glory; and there
<note n="r" place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.31.</note> is no place, time, action, in the which hee ought not, but procure and aduance his glory.

Euery man ought to doe as much; we haue waſted and conſumed Gods goods, and by our owne fault are brought to that extremitie, that we haue not wherewith to pay. But pouertie, and ſpecially that which proceeds from bad husbandry, and vnthriftineſſe is no acquit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance; and binds not the creditor to cancell and blot out our bill and obligation, and cannot hinder the creditor to aske iuſtly that which is his due. Secondly, by right of redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, we are the redeemed of our Lord Ieſus, he hath purchaſed vs with his owne pretious blood. And there is nothing in vs, for the which he hath not ſpilt his bloud; nothing therefore but ought to bee for him, but we are bound to dedicate and conſecrate to his glorie in the higheſt degree, and with the greateſt intention that can be poſſible to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> creature.

<note place="margin">The perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of parts.</note> the one is of this mortall life, the other of life eternall; in this life, that man whom the Spirit of Chriſt reneweth, is ſanctified in all the parts of his ſoule and of his body; his vnderſtanding is enligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tened, his heart ſoftned and made pliant; of a ſtonie one it is made fleſhie, or rather of a ſtone it is made fleſh: his affections are freed from the bondage of ſinne, and ranged vnder the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of the vnderſtanding and of the will; all the members of his body, al his parts and limmes, his eyes, his eares, his tongue, his feete his hands, &amp;c. are ſanctified to ſerue vnto righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in holines. But it is ſo, that in euery part there is alwaies ſome imperfection in this life: for the light of the vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding is mingled with darkeneſſe, the doctrine of the will is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected by the naturall peruerſitie remaining yet in it; the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe of the affections is ſoiled and troubled with euill, villa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous and diſordered motions; and the limmes of the body are often applied vnto filthineſſe and wickedneſſe. In like manner in regard of the Law, he which is led and guided by the Spirit of Ieſus, is ſanctified in regard of all the Commandements of the Law. He findes them equally iuſt, he affects them all, hee applies himſelfe to the obſeruation of all of them, without o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting any one; and notwithſtanding by reaſon of his frailty he cannot keepe ſo much as one perfectly (namely, with all his heart, with all his ſoule, with all his thought, with all his ſtrength) for God onely, without mingling therein the conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:12289:83"/>of his owne intereſt, which is the perfection which the Law commaunds, and demaunds vnder paine of damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p n="4">IV. Becauſe this imperfect perfection reſides and remaines in all the parts of the ſoule, and of the body, as in his ſubiect; and extendeth it ſelfe vnto all the parts of the Law, as to his obiect; it is termed, <hi>The perfection of parts,</hi> and is a ſure marke, whereby a man ſhall know, whether he be renewed or no, and whether he haue a heart without hypocriſie. For the whole re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion of an hypocrite is vpon the tippe of his tongue, and at his fingers endes; it conſiſts wholly in words and outward ſhew, his heart is farre from God, as it is written,

If difficult, how dare you ſay, that the Commandements of God, which none hath kept and obſerued, be eaſe?

<pb n="141" facs="tcp:12289:85"/>anſwering vnto that which they did produce and alleage con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the poſſibilitie and impoſſibilitie of the Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, hee ſaith, <hi>Hath God commanded, that I ſhould bee that which God is? that there ſhould be no difference betweene me and the Creator? that I ſhould be aduanced higher then the Angels? and that I ſhould haue that which the Angels haue not?

The ſenſe and meaning is, that the impoſſibilitie of the Law proceedes not from the Law; for if a man could keepe the whole Law, it would iuſtifie him: but it comes from the fleſh, that is to ſay, from the corruption of the humane nature, which makes man vncapable to fulfill the Law, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently makes the Law vnable to iuſtifie man.

<pb n="144" facs="tcp:12289:87"/>man which cannot fulfill it. By it he accuſeth and conuinceth him of ſinne, hee condemnes him for his ſinne, to this intent that from being proud, he may waxe humble; that ſeeing, that feeling thereby his maladie, he may cry to the throne of grace, and aske for the Phiſitian; that finding himſelfe the ſlaue of ſinne, he may implore the helpe of the Redeemer.

When man is thus of great made little; when from whole and ſound that he thought he was, he findes himſelfe mortally ſicke; from being aliue, he feeles him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe dead; when he ſees hell open to ſwallow him vp, without hope of recouerie, and ſo is as it were reduced, and brought to deſpaire, then is he diſpoſed and prepared to receiue his Patent of pardon, to heare the good newes of the preaching of faith: for the Law leades him to the Goſpell, <hi>Moſes</hi> to Chriſt, the preaching of the righteouſneſſe by workes, to the preaching of the righteouſneſſe by faith.

                  <p n="2">II. I anſwere to this obiection three manner of waies. Firſt, that which God doth perfectly, is imperfectly comprehended of vs; we are alwaies children, alwaies diſciples, and do learne imperfectly and with great difficultie the perfect leſſon of our Maſter. The documents and precepts of Ieſus Chriſt were perfect.

                     <hi>he ſhall teach you all things, and bring all things to your remembrance whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer I haue ſaid vnto you,

                  </p>
                  <p n="3">III. Secondly, although that which God doth, is perfect in his degree &amp; ranke, and that our regeneration is perfect, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of the perfection of parts: he works but ſucceſſiuely &amp; by degrees in vs, becauſe that being a free agent, he doth al things in all men, according vnto the counſell of his good will. To be borne deformed, blind crump-ſhouldred, a cripple, &amp;c. is a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, an imperfection, in compariſon of <hi>Moſes,</hi> that was

God, who created our firſt father, created him a perfect man in the full meaſure of age and ſtature; but he hath determined, that all they which deſcend from him, ſhould be borne babes, and ſhould grow from age to age, vntill they came to mans eſtate; the firſt age being imperfect, in compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the ſecond, and ſo conſequently vnto the declining age,

                  </p>
                  <p n="4">IIII. Thirdly, all the workes that God makes alone, and without the co-working of the creature, are perfect in their kinde: but in our regeneration our will workes together with God, &amp; the fleſh that is in vs by nature, reſiſts the Spirit, which he puts in vs by grace; whence it is impoſſible, but that the good workes which we doe, haue a ſmacke of the corruption
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:12289:91"/>that is in vs. An expert Scriuener handling alone his pen, will write neately and perfectly: but if he holdes his young Schol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers hand, and guides his pen in his hand, the writing will not be ſo neate, and will manifeſt it ſelfe by her imperfection, that it is not the Maſters hand alone; as it will appeare alſo by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the ſtraightneſſe, meaſure, and neatneſſe, that it is not the Schollers hand alone. Euen ſo is it with vs, all the good workes we doe, doe iſſue and proceede from two contrarie principles in vs, from Gods Spirit, and from our fleſh. God doth them in vs and by vs, as by young ignorant prentiſes and nouices, which cannot follow the perfect direction of the Spirit, by reaſon of our fleſh vnprofitable and vnſeruiceable to good, and ſtrong vnto euill; whence it followeth, that as they are defectiue and vicious, they belong to vs as our owne; ſo as they are good and holy, God claimes and challenges them himſelfe as his owne.</p>
                  <p n="5">V. Now followeth the anſwere to the laſt obiection:

                     </note> If our good works are thus vicious and corrupt, then are they ſinnes; and if ſinnes, then worthie of death; and therefore are not to be done, but are to be left vndone, yea, auoided. It would alſo follow, that God ſhould bee the author of ſinne, for hee is the author of euery good worke in vs,

Moreouer, God hath appointed this world to be the campe place of battell, where his Church is exerciſed in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual fight; as hath appointed heauen to be the place, where it ſhall triumph eternally ouer all her enemies. If that part of the Church, which is now glorious and without wrinkle in heauen, had not been thus Militant in this world, it ſhould not be now triumphant in heauen. For if there be no enemy, there is no victorie, no triumph, and conſequently no crowne, no price:

<pb n="158" facs="tcp:12289:94"/>more ſenſible, that he ſaues vs, notwithſtanding our infirmities and great imperfections. T'is that which he ſaid vnto S. <hi>Paul,

The Scriptures are contained in the ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of ancient Prophets, in the bookes of the Euangeliſts and Apoſtles. <hi>Bellarmine</hi> hath found nothing for his Counſels in the Prophets, let vs ſee if hee can finde any thing to ſerue his turne in the writings of the Euangeliſts and Apoſtles.

Not children, who in ſeruing God, haue no other ſcope nor ende, then the glory of God; who would bee contented to bee blotted out of his booke of life, to be accurſed and ſeparated from Chriſt their deare Sauiour (if it could bee poſſible), if that could aduance his glory. Hirelings worthy to be expelled out of the houſe of God, as enemies of his grace, who will reckon with God, and binde him to giue them, as a reward iuſtly due to them, that which hee declares to be a free gift of his grace: vnworthie that Chriſt ſhould aduow and take them for his owne, ſeeing that they depriue him of his glorie, and attribute to themſelues the reward which is not due, which is not giuen but to his merit. Let them not cry out, The ancient Fathers,

                     <hi>Charitie requires onely that we loue our neighbour as our ſelues, and therefore re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires not that we giue all that wee haue to our neighbour, and
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:12289:116"/>keepe nothing for our ſelues: but wee keepe this Commandement if we giue partly, and retaine in part.</hi> But <hi>Bellarmine</hi> diſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleth to ſay, that in the Commandement, <hi>Thou ſhalt loue thy neighbour as thy ſelfe,</hi> the word <hi>As</hi> doth not ſignifie the quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titie, meaſure, and rule of our charitie, but onely the qualitie thereof: for we loue our ſelues without meaſure and limit, and God will not haue vs to loue our neighbour in this manner. Furthermore, if the loue we beare to our ſelues, <hi>were the rule of our charitie towards our neighbour,</hi> the common prouerb would be true, <hi>that charitie begins at her ſelfe.</hi> But reaſon and experience ſheweth, that to be falſe; for we are bound to loue Father, Mother, our King, our Country, the Church of God more then our ſelues. The Scripture ſaith, that

                     <hi>looke not euery man on his owne things, but euery man on the things of others;</hi> wherefore this <hi>As</hi> is not a marke of equalitie, but of ſimilitude, and ſignifies the truth and ſinceritie that ought to be in our charitie: for as wee loue our ſelues in truth, and without diſſimulation or reſeruation; ſo ought we to loue <hi>our neighbour,
<note n="u" place="margin">1. <hi>Iohn</hi> 3.18.</note> not in word, neither in tongue, but in deede and in truth,</hi> ſaith Saint <hi>Iohn.</hi> The rule and mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of our loue towards our neighbour, <hi>is the loue of Christ towards vs;

<note n="y" place="margin">1. <hi>Iohn</hi> 3.16.</note> 
                     <hi>Hereby perceiue we the loue of God, becauſe he laid downe his life for vs, and we ought to lay downe our liues for the brethren.</hi> If <hi>our liues,</hi> how much more all our goods, that are not ſo much as our life is? Secondly, Ieſus Chriſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding this rich man to ſell all that hee had, did not bid him giue all to the poore, to become a beggar, a vagabond, and a wallet bearer; for in the Text there is but, and <hi>giue to the poore.</hi> Now he could haue giue of his all, without giuing all. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Chriſt would haue made him a Diſciple, and one of his attendants and followers during the dayes of his fleſh; and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards a Preacher of his Goſpell in thoſe places where it would haue pleaſed him to haue ſent him; he commands him
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:12289:116"/>to ridde himſelfe ſpeedily of his poſſeſſions, that they might not with-hold, nor hinder him to follow Gods calling, and to giue liberally to the poore; but hee commaunds him not to giue them to the poore, without reſeruing any thing for his need; and there is nothing in the Text, from whence they can gather any ſuch, either Commandement or Counſell. Thirdly, it is true in generall, that charitie requires not of vs, that wee giue all we haue to the poore, without any reſeruation for our ſelues, neither alſo that wee ſell all that we haue, for ordinarily this ſentence of the Apoſtle takes place,
<note n="a" place="margin">2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.13.</note> 
                     <hi>I meane not that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther men be eaſed, and you burthened, but by an equalitie.</hi> But ſuch a time may happen, that a man ſhall be called of God, to lay downe not all his goods onely, but his life alſo for his bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren; then ſuch a one receiueth of God a true Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to doe ſo; if he doth not ſo, he tranſgreſſeth the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement of God, and becomes guiltie before God. It is not a generall Commandement to euery man, to goe out of his Countrie to ſerue God, and to offer vp to God his children to obey God. Notwithſtanding, this was a particular Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement giuen <hi>to

Thus although it be not a generall Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement of charitie, to ſell all that wee haue, and to giue it all to the poore; yet was it a Commandement of charitie par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly giuen, and in expreſſe termes from Chriſts owne mouth to this young Ruler; who for not obeying thereunto, is by the Lord declared to be excluded out of the Kingdome of heauen.

                     <hi>prayed him that hee might be with him, but Ieſus ſuffered him not.</hi> But moſt commonly <hi>to follow Chriſt,</hi> is to deny himſelfe, to take vp the croſſe of Chriſt, to reſt in him with a true and liuely faith, and depend on him in life and death. This fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing is common to all, commanded to all men:

But we will ſpeake of this here below, as alſo of the intention of the Apoſtle in this Chapter.</p>
                  <p n="7">VII. The which I will but touch curſarily in this place; the Corinthians asked the Apoſtle, if it was expedient for a
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:12289:123"/>Chriſtian to marrie. He anſweres:
<note n="f" place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.1.</note> 
                     <hi>Now concerning the things where of yee wrote vnto me, it is good for a man not to touch a woman,</hi> calling good that which is commodious, profitable, and as he himſelfe expounds it, verſ. 35. <hi>expedient or comely;</hi> he giues the reaſon, ſaying, that they that marry, <hi>ſhall haue trouble in the fleſh,</hi> verſ. 28. It is therefore good to bee vnmarried by reaſon of the charges and troubles of marriage, and of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbance that it bringeth to the free confeſſion of the Goſpell in time of perſecution: as he ſaith, verſ. 26. <hi>I ſuppoſe that this is good for the preſent diſtreſſe and neceſſitie.</hi> For then the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutions were ſo hot and violent, that they which were with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out wife and children, were freed from a great burden, hauing nothing to care for but Gods ſeruice and themſelues. Thoſe during that preſent neceſſitie, did well not to marrie. This is the Apoſtles aduice; yet not abſolutely, but with a reſtriction of the gift and vocation of God, ſaying, that marriage is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarie for them that haue not receiued the gift of continencie;
<note n="g" place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.2.</note> 
                     <hi>Neuertheles to auoide fornication, let euery man haue his owne wife, and let euery woman haue her own husband.

But the words are of the imperatiue moode, and binde all thoſe which haue not the gift of continencie to marry. He repeates them againe, and ſaith, <hi>If they cannot containe, let them marry, for it is better to marry then to burne.</hi> Concerning thoſe that haue the gift of conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nencie, he ſaith,

                     <hi>It is good for them, if they abide euen as I;</hi> yea, he commaunds them ſo to remaine, if they feele in themſelues that they are called to it of God;

                     <hi>As God hath diſtributed to euery man,</hi> there is the gift, yea, <hi>as the Lord hath called euery one,</hi> there is Gods calling; <hi>ſo let him walke.</hi> Now where there is the gift and calling of God to a thing, there is a neceſſitie to doe it, and a puniſhment for him that doth it not.
<note n="k" place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.24.</note> 
                     <hi>Brethren,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>let euery man wherein hee is called, therein abide with God.</hi> If then a man hath receiued the gift of continencie, and is called thereto by God, he ought to follow his calling. But if he burnes, and feeles that the gift is taken away, God calles
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:12289:123"/>him to marriage. It is a Commandement on the one and the other ſide, and not a Counſell.</p>

                     <hi>So then he that giueth her in marriage doth well; but hee that giueth her not in marriage doth better.</hi> To wit, becauſe that this man lookes better to his virgin, in not giuing her in marriage in ſo dangerous and troubleſome a time (it being preſuppoſed that ſhe haue the gift of continencie) then doth that man. In like manner, the widow

The preaching without wages freely is it an Euangelicall Counſell? if it be, where, to whom, by whom gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, kept by whom? not by the Apoſtles, not by the ancient Biſhops, not by the moderne Biſhops, not by Friers and Monkes. How few Biſhops, Prieſts, Monkes can preach? How great is the number of thoſe perfect ones, that cannot ſo much as reade well? And how few are they which in preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing recommend not their wallet &amp; bagge? that would preach if it were not for the ſcrip? that would doe the office, if it were not for the benefice?</p>
                  <p n="3">III. Let vs leaue this trifling, and let vs ſeeke in the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle the meaning of his words. The Corinthians were a coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous people, and giuen to lucre. The Apoſtle had conuerted them to the Goſpell without charges to them, for the reaſon he renders, verſ. 12. <hi>We haue not vſed this power, but ſuffer all things, lest we ſhould hinder the Goſpell of Chriſt.</hi> This people would not haue bought the Goſpell with money, his enemies would haue accuſed him of couetouſneſſe, would haue vpbrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded him, that he preached the Goſpell for his belly-ſake, would haue ſlaundered him, and called him an hireling. The coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſſe
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:12289:125"/>of thoſe, and the malicious calumnies of theſe would haue hindred the courſe of the Goſpell. The Apoſtle knowing this, did labour with his hands; and when his worke could not ſuffice, hee liued by the liberalitie and maintenance of other Churches:
<note n="x" place="margin">2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.9.</note> 
                     <hi>When I was preſent with you and wanted, I was chargeable to no man; for that which was lacking to me, the bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren which came from Macedonia ſupplied, and in all things I haue kept my ſelfe from being burthenſome to you, and ſo will I keepe my ſelfe.</hi> Surely in regard of his place and office, they owed him his intertainement, and he might haue iuſtly deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded and taken it: but by reaſon of the circumſtances, and of the ende of his function, he might not haue asked it, nor taken it. The ende of his calling was the edification of the people, the aduancement of the Goſpell. Now he confeſſeth, if he had been at charges with them, he had hindered the Goſpell, therefore he might not doe it.
<note n="y" place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.23.</note> 
                     <hi>All things</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>are lawfull for me, but all things are not expedient; all things are lawfull for mee, but all things edifie not.</hi> This was one of thoſe things; If hee had taken wages of the Corinthians, he had not edified, he had brought hinderance to the Goſpell, for the which it was expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient, yea, neceſſarie that hee ſhould ſpare them: for in things indifferent, as this was one, that which is lawfull in it ſelfe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commeth vnlawfull, by reaſon of the circumſtances of times, places, perſons, &amp;c. The other Apoſtles did liue of the Goſpell without ſcandall giuen or taken, becauſe they preached the Goſpell to a free and willing people.

Surely euen the very ſame that is his ſtipend, his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward. <hi>For</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>if I do this thing willingly, I haue my reward.</hi> What reward haue I then? A ſpeciall glory before God (ſaith <hi>Bellarmine:</hi>) but he himſelfe ſaith not ſo; but his glory, his reward is, <hi>that when I preach the Goſpell, I may make the Goſpell of Chriſt without charge.</hi> This glory, this reward, that he hath preached the Goſpell, and aduanced the Kingdome of Chriſt without charges to them, is more to him then all the riches; a glory then which hee had among men, and not before God. And thus hee hath himſelfe expounded it, telling them elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where,

                     <hi>As the truth of Chriſt is in me, no man ſhall ſtop mee of this boaſting in the regions of Achaia.</hi> A glory, in that he <hi>had not been burthenſome to them,</hi> as he ſaith in the line going be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, <hi>and glory in the regions of Achaia,</hi> and not in heauen; and that to the ende that <hi>I abuſe not my power in the Goſpell.</hi> Which he expounds, when he ſaith in the eleuenth Chapter of his ſecond Epiſtle, which may ſerue as a commentarie vpon this place, <hi>What I doe, that I will doe, that I may cut off occaſion from them which deſire occaſion:</hi> for he ſinnes grieuouſly that giues (in the vſe of things indifferent) occaſion to any, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe or forſake the Goſpell.</p>
                  <p n="4">IIII. Therefore we ſee here; firſt, that the Apoſtle abſtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned not to take wages of the Corinthians for any hope of a greater reward before God, but hee abſtained, that hee ſhould not abuſe his power in the miniſterie of the Goſpell, and in ſo doing, to hinder the aduancement of the Goſpell of Chriſt. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, that his glory and his reward is not a greater perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and merit, but the contentment he had to haue preached to them the Goſpell without taking any thing, and that they had heard him, without giuing him any thing; for if to preach without wages, deſerueth an <hi>Aureola,</hi> and a certaine higher degree in heauen, the good Saint <hi>Peter</hi> ſhall not be the Prince of the Apoſtles in heauen; but becauſe hee hath liued here of the Goſpell, ſhall bee ſeated, and ſhall remaine in a place and degree inferiour to the Apoſtle Saint <hi>Paul.</hi> Thirdly, that in all this he hath done nought, but that he ſhould haue done. For when the Law permits the vſe of things indifferent, it is alwaies with the exception of ſcandale of the weake. And ſo doth the

                  <p n="6">VI. This is as little to the purpoſe as the reſt, they ſhould proue to vs, that there are Euangelicall Counſels, that the vow of virginitie is recommended in the Goſpell, and that ſuch a vow merits a greater glory. And they tell vs, that there are
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:12289:127"/>virgines in heauen, &amp;c. Who doubts but that there are many? but they muſt proue, that they were ſuch by vow, and by the obſeruation of Euangelicall Counſels, and that in Saint <hi>Iohns</hi> time there were Cloiſters of men and Nunneries of maides. That was their taske, from the which they loſe themſelues, and doe toile in vaine to proue that, which no man denies them, that there are many virgins in heauen. That is their firſt fault, which is followed by another greater: for to exalt virginitie or chaſtitie, they alleage a place, which being vnderſtood lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally and ſtrictly of virgins that neuer liued in matrimonie, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folds vntruths, abſurdities, and no ſmall inconueniences: firſt, that in heauen there is a defect and imperfection in all the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Saints, which had indeuored and laboured to haue learne this new Song, and could not learne it. What, was it too deepe for their ſmall capacitie? or too long for their ſhort memorie? either they ought to haue learned it, or elſe they ought not to haue learned it; if they ought not to haue learned it, then they haue out-gone their commiſſion, and ouer-paſſed their dutie, and in ſo doing haue ſinned; and if they ſinne, or can ſin, they are not happy. If they ought and would haue learned it, but could not compaſſe it, they are yet defectiue and imperfect; and therfore they are not happy. Secondly, that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> other Saints were not redeemed from among men. For this is the priui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of thoſe hundred and foure and fortie thouſand.

Iuſtin</hi> and <hi>Cyprian</hi> ſay not that virginitie is a fruit of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell: for that which is common to Chriſtians and Heathens is not of the Goſpell; but they recommend thoſe, which in ſo wofull a time wherein the fires were lighted, the ſword drawne, the publicke power and ſtrength armed with fury, with threatnings, and with vengeance againſt the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, did abſtaine from marriage for the Kingdome of Heauens ſake. For he who in time of perſecution is charged with wife,
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:12289:134"/>and children, and ſees himſelfe brought to this hard neceſſitie, either to bow the knee before <hi>Baal,</hi> or to be depriued of that wherewith hee ſhould ſuſtaine his family; to bee ſeparated by baniſhment or death from thoſe that are the halfe of himſelfe, his fleſh, his bones, and his bloud; or elſe to traile and leade them all after him with great feare, toyle, and continuall danger, hath no ſmall tentations; hee that faints not, nor yeeldes vnto them, may well ſay, that hee hath in him a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſtrength, then that of the world. But hee which is alone, whether he muſt flie, or muſt die for the Goſpell, is farre from theſe tentations, and is rid from all that which might ſtay him, which might diuert, or quench the zeale, whereby he is carried to a free and conſtant profeſſion of the Goſpell. For which cauſe the ancient Fathers ſeeing the Church of God preſſed and oppreſſed with this neceſſitie, did by long and vehement orations, exhort men and maides to virginitie; and many of them did follow their exhortations, not by vow, but by Gods gift and calling, not by ſuperſtition and opinion of any merit and greater perfection, but to apply themſelues the better to the ſeruice of God with leſſe diſturbance, without ſhutting themſelues into a Monaſterie, without forſaking their houſes, without ſelling their goods, or leauing them, and without ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themſelues to a continuall continencie.
